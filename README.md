### Introduction
This project develops an expert system to assist high school or first-year university students in selecting the most suitable academic major based on their interests and skills. The system uses CLIPS for logical rule processing and integrates with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python and Tkinter for easy data input and result display.

### Project Objectives
  1. Help students choose an appropriate university major.
  2. Provide an intuitive and interactive user interface.
  3. Integrate an expert system (CLIPS) with a GUI (Python).

### Project Tools
 - Programming Languages: CLIPS, Python
 - Python Libraries: Tkinter, clips
 - Development Environment: Any environment supporting Python and CLIPS (e.g. CLIPSWin)
 - Operating System: Any system supporting Python and CLIPS

### System Workflow
 * Data Input: The user selects preferences via checkboxes in the Tkinter GUI.
 * Data Processing: Responses are passed to the CLIPS engine as facts.
 * Rule Application: CLIPS analyzes the facts using logical rules.
 * Result Display: The suggested major is shown in the GUI with a pop-up message.
